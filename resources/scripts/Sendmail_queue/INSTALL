----------- Setting up MailWatch to see the sendmail queue

Edit mailq.php first to change the require line to point to the location of functions.php, then:

# cp tools/Sendmail_queue/mailq.php /usr/local/bin
# crontab -e
0-59 * * * * 	/usr/local/bin/mailq.php

Note: mailq.php re-creates all entries on each run, so for busy sites you will probably want to change this to run every 5 minutes or greater.
